### Interests

With a decade of experience under my belt and having graduated from an academy sponsored by Microsoft for IT, networking, security, and fiber optics, with several certifications and awards, computer science has become very influential in my life. This field is something I am very passionate about, leading me to strive for exponential growth and improvement. I observe like a satellite to learn from the mistakes of others while finding inspiration from those greater than me. I Inherently believe you can never know too much and also believe that the only way to improve is by giving back to others and sharing our knowledge, making me highly supportive of OSS.

### Give me something to do?

I'm always interested in helping and educating those wanting to become, or be better, programmers, engineers, and computer scientists. Especially those developing with C#. Have a question or stuck on something? Something not working right? Don't know where to begin? Reach out to me and let's figure this out together.
